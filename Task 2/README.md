# Using CIFAR-10 Dataset to Train a CNN and VGG19 model

This readme file provides instructions and information on how to use the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and VGG19 model  . The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The goal is to train a CNN model that can accurately classify these images into their respective classes.

## Model

Here, the CIFAR-10 dataset is used to train CNN and VGG19 model.


## SetUp 

1. Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You will need a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train the models. You may also need other libraries for data preprocessing and visualization.

2. Download the Dataset: You can download the CIFAR-10 dataset from the official website or through APIs provided by deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

3. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images before feeding them into the  model. Common preprocessing steps include normalization (scaling pixel values to a range of 0 to 1), data augmentation (to improve model generalization), and reshaping images to match the network's input shape.

4. Model Architecture: Design your model architecture. You can start with a simple architecture and gradually increase complexity. You may use standard layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. 

5. Model Training: Train the CNN model on the training dataset. Use appropriate loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) and optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, SGD) to train the model. Monitor training and validation accuracy/loss to avoid overfitting.

6. Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate your model's performance on the test dataset. Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Conclusion
Training a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset is a great way to learn about image classification using deep learning. Experiment with different architectures and techniques to achieve the best possible performance. Happy coding!
