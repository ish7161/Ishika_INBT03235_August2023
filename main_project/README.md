## Dataset

This dataset contains a collection of movie reviews from the IMDb website, along with corresponding sentiment labels. The reviews are labeled as either positive or negative to facilitate sentiment analysis tasks. This dataset is commonly used in the field of natural language processing for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.



## Model

 Here, I have used Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. 
5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
6. Train the model: Utilize a classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes to build a model .
7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, confusion matrix, and acurracy to assess the model's performance.
8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions.

Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.

## Evaluation

The performance of the  model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
